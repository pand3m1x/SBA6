// Implement Utilities:

//Tax Calculator Module (taxCalculator.ts):
// Create a calculateTax() function to handle tax
//  calculations for products.
// This function should return the dollar amount that a product
//  is taxed at. For example, if a product costs $100 and is taxed at 
//  10%, the function should return $10.
// Note that the product data returned from the API does not include
//  a taxPercentage field like it includes a discountPercentage field. 
//  Apply a default standard tax rate of 4.75% to each product; however, 
//  products with a category of “groceries” should only be taxed at 3%.

import {Product} from '../models/Product.js'

export function calculateTax(product:Product): number {
  return product.getCalculateTax(price * (taxRate+1)); 
}
