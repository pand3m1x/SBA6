Write a reflection of roughly 300 words addressing:
How you implemented TypeScript features and OOP principles.

    I used the protected access modifier to allow information that shouldn't
    be accessible to the public but still needs to be called to from other places.
    I don't think I was successful in implimenting polymorphism. I didn't get to the
    point in which I needed an inheritance. 

The challenges you encountered and how you overcame them.

    The biggest challenge I enocuntered and couldn't figure out what how
    to design something around the DummyJSON product API because I couldn't figure
    out to read it to know how I wanted to design things. But I just asked during 
    class and learned how to git information out of an API using the URL bar, which
    was pretty cool. 

    I also struggle with making structures out of nothing, and inutively constructing things,
    so I revisted the modules and MDN, but it takes a lot of time to check everything.

How you handled asynchronous operations and error management.

    I copied and pasted code from a prior assignment, not sure if the adjustments I
    made work or not, because I am confused on how to check something in ts files or
    do I have to compile first? I did try the ts-node and the targeted file, but
    I think I messed up my tsconfig somewhere.
